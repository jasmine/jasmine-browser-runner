# jasmine-browser-runner 2.0.0-beta.0 Release Notes

## Breaking Changes

* jasmine-core peer dependency updated to 5.0.0-beta.0

  The upgrade to 5.0 should be seamless for most jasmine-browser-runner users,
  however, there are a few breaking changes to be aware of. Please see the
  [jasmine-core 5.0.0-alpha-0](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.0.0-alpha.0.md),
  [5.0.0-alpha-1](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.0.0-alpha.1.md),
  and [5.0.0-beta-0](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.0.0-beta.0.md)
  release notes for details.

* Backslashes in file globs are interpreted as the start of escape sequences on
  all OSes. Previous versions of Jasmine used a version of the glob package that
  treated them as directory separators on Windows and the start of escape
  sequences on other OSes.

* Safari 14, Firefox 91, and Node <19 are no longer supported.

## New Features

* Opt-in support for top-level-await

  This can be enabled by adding enableTopLevelAwait: true to the configuration.
  It's off by default because HTTP requests for scripts are performed
  sequentially rather than potentially in parallel. This comes at a cost in
  performance but is the only way to ensure a stable order when randomization
  is disabled or a random seed is specified.
